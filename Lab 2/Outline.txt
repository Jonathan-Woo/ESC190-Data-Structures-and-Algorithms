1. For a linked list struct defined as below, write a function that prints out all 
   the data in the linked list. Do not use recursion.

struct node{
    int data; 
    struct node *next; 
};

2. Same as (1), but now use recursion.

3. Implement a linked list (with print and append) that can store objects of
   type int, float, and double. Use the following struct:

struct node{
    void *p_data; //a pointer to data (allocated with malloc)
    int type; // 0 if int, 1 if float, 2 if double
    struct node *next;
}
  
   You may like to write the functinos append_int, append_float, and append_double separately
