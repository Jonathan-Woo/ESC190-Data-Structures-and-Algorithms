1. Write a header file for operating on linked lists (include at least inserting a value, deleting a node, and freeing the entire linked list). Write a file linkedlists.c that implements the functions declared in the h file. Now write a main fail with a main function that uses the functions declared in the h file. Make sure that everything compiles and runs correctly.

2. In Python, write a function find(L, e) that takes in a sorted list L and an element e, and returns the lowest index in L such that L[i] == e. (-1 if there is no such index)
   Write a function that takes in a sorted linst L and an element e, and returns the index of the highest index in L such that L[i] == e. (-1 if there is no such index).
   This should help you with Project 1.
